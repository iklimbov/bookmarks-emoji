I am Canadian software developer. I invented <span style="white-space: nowrap;">bookmarks + emoji</span> while trying to stay busy during COVID, since, like many others, I lost my regular job. This project took several months of hard work and I hope it will make your life a little easier, sillier, and more organized.</p><p>Exactly like you, I am worried and saddened by what is happening in the world right now and wish I could do something to help. If you enjoy my extension and want to give back, please donate using a link below. For every $10 raised, $8 will go to support charities in the Third World countries. I will be posting updates on how much was raised and where it was spent on the extension page.</p><p>Stay safe!</p><p></p><form action=https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr method=post target=_blank><input type=hidden name=cmd value=_s-xclick> <input type=hidden name=hosted_button_id value=PZNUP8KV37BM4> <input type=image class=donate_button src=./images/donate1.png name=submit title="PayPal - The safer, easier way to donate online!" alt="Thank you for donating with PayPal"></form><p></p></div><div class=cent_drk1 id=howto_page hidden><h1>bookmarks + emoji</h1><h2>features + faq&nbsp;</h2><div class=cards><div class=card><p><img class=main_img src=images/icon_128.png></p><p>Up to 512 icons can be replaced with emojis.</p><p>Emoji is assigned to domain + path combination. That means, assigning emoji to one bookmark will assign the same emoji to bookmarks with similar URL.</p><p>Not all emojis are supported by all operating systems. If your emoji is not displayed properly (usually you will see a grey rectangle) simply replace emoji.</p><p>Please report bugs and suggest new features using "contact" form. I will also be glad to receive your collaboration requests and ideas for new projects.</p><p>If you like my work, post a review and share it with your friends.</p></div><div class=card_wide><h3>Customizing Bookmarks with Emoji</h3><p>Replace default icons for bookmarks or folders with emoji. Right click icon to customize and select Emoji dialog. Alternatively, this option is available in the Edit dialog. Take your time selecting meaningful emojis. Use "Remove emoji" button to remove currently selected emoji.</p><img class=card_img src=images/ht6.png></div><div class=card><h3>Simple Tree</h3><p>In this view bookmarks are organized into the tree with titles beside icons. Sort bookmarks by titles or number of uses.</p><img class=card_img src=images/ht1.png></div><div class=card><h3>Icons only</h3><p>But what if you know your bookmarks pretty well? Do you really want to read titles every time? In icons-only view, sorting is not super intuitive.</p><img class=card_img src=images/ht2.png></div><div class=card_wide><h3>Tree vs Single Folder View</h3><p>This button lets you select between tree and single-folder views.</p><table class=desc_table><tr><td style="width: 25%;">Tree view is like a traditional file explorer view on your computer.</td><td>Folder View includes navigator panel with shortcuts to all available folders. The content of the selected folder is presented below the breadcrumbs.</td><td>To make the most out of single folder navigator, take your time and set custom emoji icons for all your folders. You will not regret the result!</td></tr></table><img class=card_img src=images/ht4.png></div><div class=card><h3>Archiving</h3><p>Bookmarks not used during past 90 days are moved to the Archive folder, located under the Other Bookmarks. Review them and get rid of them, if you wish.</p><img class=card_img src=images/ht3.png></div><div class=card><h3>Deleting</h3><p>Deleted bookmarks are moved into Recycling Bin. Deleting from Recycling Bin cannot be undone. Recycling Bin is located under Other Bookmarks.</p><img class=card_img src=images/ht5.png></div><div class=card_wide><h3>More...</h3><p>Switch the lights off to use dark mode.
