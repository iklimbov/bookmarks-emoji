        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>
               I am Canadian software developer and Argentine tango dancer. 
          Staying in safe Canada and listening to the news about devastation 
          in the third-world countries is saddening and depressing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to raise some money to help and I also wanted to offer you something in return. 
          That is how bookmarks + emoji came to be.
          This project is a fundraiser for the dance community in Argentina, 
          where dancers and teachers are out-of-job with no support from the government since March 2020.
          Eight out of ten dollars raised will be donated to charity; last two dollars are going to my â˜• fund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design and development took all my awake time during the past three months, 
          so if you find this extension useful and donate, you will be paying for my hard work.
        </p>
        <p>
          About me: programmer, data scientist, mother, dancer, motorcycle enthusiast, rock climber.

              You can replace upto 512 icons with emojis because of the Chrome storage limitation.
           </p>
            <p>
              Emoji is assigned to domain + path combination. 
              That means, assigning emoji to a bookmark will assign the same emoji to bookmarks with similar URL.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not all emojis are supported by all operating systems. 
              If your emoji is not displayed properly on one of the computers simply replace emoji.

              Replace default icons for bookmarks or folders with emoji. Right click icon to customize and select Emoji dialog. Alternatively, this option is available in the Edit dialog. 
              Take your time selecting meaningful emojis. You can remove emoji in Emoji dialog or by clearing the preview box in Edit dialog.

            <p>
              Bookmarks are organized into the tree with titles beside icons. Sort bookmarks by titles or number of uses.

            <h3>Tree vs Single Folder View</h3>
            <p>
              Tree view displays all the folders at the same time. 
              Folder View includes navigator panel and shows only one folder at a time. 
              To make the most out of single folder navigator, take your time 
              and set custom emoji icons for all your folders. You will not regret the result!
